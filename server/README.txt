Only tested on 1.40 so far.

Navigate to your tribes server folder, e.g.:

C:\retro_141_tribes\base\scripts\server

Make a backup if you wish, then extract and overwrite.

Note that the routes included with this version were just quick test routes I recorded, you will need to provide your own routes for now.
